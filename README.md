👋 Hey! I'm Arthur, I'm an **IT student** exploring the world of software development. This profile showcases my progress — from basic assignments to more complex C++ and Python projects.

---

### 🔧 What you'll find here:

- 🧠 **C++ Homeworks & Practice** – Covering OOP, polymorphism, operator overloading, STL templates, and simple game logic.
- 🌐 **Web Development Projects** – HTML/CSS/JS experiments and apps from my school WEB dev track.
- 🐍 **Python Scripts** – Automation tools, number games, health checkers, and API-based visualizations.
- 📁 **CodeAC** – A mixed bag of C++ and frontend code snippets built while learning and tinkering.

---

I enjoy solving problems, building functional code, and diving deeper into how things work. 
Whether it's matrix rotations or class hierarchies — I’m always eager to learn more and improve. 🚀

      🖥️ <strong>TryHackMe</strong> has helped me dive deeper into practical computer networking and web security.<br>
      Thanks to its hands-on approach, I now understand concepts like <i>datortīkli</i> and protocols much better.
