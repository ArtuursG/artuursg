### 🔧 What you'll find here:

- 🧠 [**C++ Homeworks & Practice**](https://github.com/ArtuursG/HomeWorks_Coding_C) - Covering OOP, polymorphism, operator overloading, STL templates, and simple game logic.
- 🌐 [**Web Development Projects**](https://github.com/ArtuursG/HomeWorks_WEB) - HTML/CSS/JS experiments and apps from my school WEB dev track.
    Additional web-related code also in [**CodeAC**](https://github.com/ArtuursG/CodeAC).
- 🐍 [**Python Scripts**](https://github.com/ArtuursG/Python) - Automation tools, number games, health checkers, and API-based visualizations.
- 📁 [**CodeAC**](https://github.com/ArtuursG/CodeAC) - A mixed bag of C++ and frontend code snippets built while learning and tinkering.

I enjoy solving problems, building functional code, and diving deeper into how things work. 
Whether it's matrix rotations or class hierarchies — I’m always eager to learn more and improve. 🚀
